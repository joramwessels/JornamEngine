# TODO
 - test ray tracer by plotting primary rays
	Weird output. Scene appears rotated. Checked all cross products, +x right, +y down, +z in, thumb = index.cross(middle)
	DrawWorldAxes() could help, but it doesn't work perfectly yet
 - write Camera rotation

 - implement user input
 - Camera DoF, FoV, and zoom
